## Open Source Contribution

- `opensourcecontribution` folder should host all open-source projects. Add your code/projects in
  this folder.
- As examples, I have added:
    - `javasampleproject` maven project with a Java application.
    - An empty `pythonsampleproject`.
    - An empty `rubysampleproject` module.

### Guidelines:

- Feel free to pick a language that is preferred.
- Create a separate module or folder for your code base.
- Add notes/instructions for running your code. Add comments wherever necessary.
- Add tests.
- Ensure your code does not break the entire codebase.
